### Decrypt Two Explanation:
This quote is talking about a problem with the way that data science is currently done, which is that when we try to understand and make predictions from data, we often don't take into account the context in which the data was collected or the relationships between different pieces of data. It is saying that we might think that two things are related when they are not directly related, and that data scientists might think that correlation is the same as causation, which is not true. It is important to be careful when interpreting data and not jump to conclusions without a deeper understanding of the context and dependencies of the data.
