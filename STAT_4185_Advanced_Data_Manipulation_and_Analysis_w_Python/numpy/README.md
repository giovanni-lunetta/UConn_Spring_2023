# STAT4185_Numpy_2023_hw

So for this assignment just try to finish as many of these Numpy Jeopardy Game questions as you can. No need to complete all of them. Both the answers and an empty copy of the questions are provided.

To access the actual questions for each problem you can use the jeopardy game at this link: https://jeopardylabs.com/play/2022-08-05-196

Feel free to check your work with the answer key and text into the discord server if you have any questions!

Note: Please try the questions first before you look at the answers! `numpy` is a pretty important library to understnad when we start talking about `pandas` and `sklearn`.

Best,

Hari
