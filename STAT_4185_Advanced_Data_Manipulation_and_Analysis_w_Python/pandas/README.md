The dataset you find in this repository is coming from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidfuenteherraiz/messy-imdb-dataset

This is a pretty messy dataset, in fact just looking at it should tell you a lot about what's wrong with it. From the Kaggle site: "This dataset contains 100 movies from the IMDb database and 11 variables: IMBd movie ID, original title, release year, genre, duration, country, content rating, director's name, worldwide income, number of votes and IMDb score. It is a messy dataset with plenty of errors to be corrected: missing values, empty rows, and columns, bad variable names, multiple or wrong date formats, numeric columns containing symbols, units, characters, thousand separators, multiple and wrong decimal separators, typographic mistakes and a multiple categorical variables miscoded as a unique character variable."

I am not gonna grade you on correctness, but I want to see that you tried! 

Best of luck and dm me if you have questions!

Best,
Hari
