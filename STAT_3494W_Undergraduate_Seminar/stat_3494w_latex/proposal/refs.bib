abstract = {Basketball is known for the vast amount of data collected for each player, team, game, and season. As a result, basketball is an ideal domain to work on different data analysis techniques to gain useful insights. In this study, we continued our previous study published in 2020 Computational Collective Intelligence (12th International Conference, ICCCI 2020, Da Nang, Vietnam, November 30 - December 3, 2020, Proceedings) reviewing some important factors to predict players' future performance and being selected in an All-Star game, one of the most prestigious events, of National Basket Association league. Besides traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning is also applied in this study for prediction purpose. However, compared to traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning's performance is not as good for our dataset. It is understandable when our data are relatively small and structured with a few predictor variables which limited Deep Learning's ability to deal with a vast amount of Big Data. Our final results, through both Regression and Classification Analysis, indicated that scoring is the most important factor from the primary players for any team and also basketball fan's favourable style.},

abstract = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) assumes that data are continuous. However, there are situations where data are integers and bounded. For example, in basketball games, the total number of points that a player has scored is an integer and cannot exceed three times of the number of point field goals that a player has attempted. Without modelling the correct data type, the DEA results can be biased and erroneous. The current paper applies a bounded integer DEA model to evaluating the performance of National Basketball Association (NBA) players when bounded integer data exist. As a result, we correctly capture the data type. The current study also develops a super-efficiency measure under the bounded integer data. The bounded integer data problem is illustrated with data involving a set of NBA shooting guards in the 2013-2014 season.},

abstract = {Paradoxical performance effects (‘choking under pressure’) are defined as the occurrence of inferior performance despite striving and incentives for superior performance. Experimental demonstrations of these effects on tasks analogous to athletic performance and the theories that may explain them are reviewed. At present, attentional theories seem to offer the most complete explanation of the processes underlying paradoxical performance effects. In particular, choking may result from distraction or from the interference of self‐focused attention with the execution of automatic responses. Experimental findings of paradoxical performance decrements are associated with four pressure variables: audience presence, competition, performance‐contingent rewards and punishments, and ego relevance of the task. The mediating factors of task complexity, expectancies, and individual differences are discussed.},
