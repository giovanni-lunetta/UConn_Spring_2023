\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Use this section to answer three questions:
Why is the topic important/interesting?
What has been done on this topic in the literature?
What is your contribution?


To cite a reference, here are examples.
\citet{xie2015dynamic} did something ... 

Considerable work has already been published in this area 
\citep[e.g.,][]{xie2015dynamic}. Some parametric bootstrap sample size 
approach was proposed by \citet{dwivedi2017analysis}. 


% roadmap
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The data will be presented in 
Section~\ref{sec:data}. Section~\ref{sec:meth} describes the methods. The 
results are reported in Section~\ref{sec:resu}. A discussion concludes in 
Section~\ref{sec:disc}.


\section{Data Description}
\label{sec:data}

Use this section to describe the data that helps to answer your research
questions. Some descriptive statistics in tables or figures are suggested 
here to summarize data.

Table~\ref{tab:rv} summarizes some distributional features for some of the 
variables in our dataset. $\ldots$

\begin{table}[!t]
  \caption{This is my first table.}
	\label{tab:rv}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
  \toprule
& Var 1 & Var 2 & Var 3 \\ 
  \midrule
Feature 1 & $-$0.110 & 4 & 2.401 \\ 
Feature 2 &    0.116 & 4 & 3.529 \\ 
Feature 3 & $-$0.066 & 6 & 11.104 \\ 
Feature 4 &    0.219 & 3 & 4.815 \\ 
Feature 5 &    0.303 & 5 & 2.188 \\ 
Feature 6 &    0.544 & 0 & 8.050 \\ 
Feature 7 & $-$2.617 & 8 & 3.646 \\ 
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}

Use this section to present the methodologies that will generate results by
analyzing the data. 

Recall Einstein's equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mc2}
  E = m c^2,
\end{equation}
which states that the energy $E$ of a particle in its rest frame as the product
of mass ($m$) with the speed of light squared ($c^2$).

Suppose that the radius of a circle is $r$. Then its area is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:area}
  \pi r^2.
\end{equation}
%
Equation~\eqref{eq:area} is interesting, although it is short, and should not
be numbered (labeled) if it is not referenced elsewhere. It would likely be 
better as an inline expression, as in `Then its area is $\pi r^2$.' {\blue This 
text is in blue. It is sometimes helpful to highlight (in color) the changes 
that were made in response to reviewer's comments.}

Sometimes I don't want an equation to be numbered such as this one:
\[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( - \frac{x^2}{2} \right),
\]
which is the density of a standard normal variable.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:resu}

Report the results generated from the methods discussed in the previous section.  
Results can be from simulation and/or real data analysis.  

Figure~\ref{fig:cars} shows the distance against the speed from this dataset.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

What are the main contributions again?
What are the limitations of this study?
What are worth pursuing further in the future?
Blah, blah, blah.  Watch for prevalence of diabetes \citep{wild2004global}.
