  Response to Reviewers
\end{center}

\subsection*{Summary}

Begin with a thank you to the reviewer(s) for carefully reading your work. When 
you submit the response-to-reviewers document with the first draft on HuskyCT, 
there will only be one reviewer -- the peer reviewer. When you submit the 
response-to-reviewers document with the final paper, there will be multiple 
reviewers to whom you need to respond: peer-reviewer (from final draft review), 
grader (from first draft review), and instructor (from first draft review).  

Refer to Note 5 on the HuskyCT course website for more details, guidelines, and 
tips.

The manuscript has been revised accordingly with the following changes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item I did this;
\item I did this also;
\item Finally, I also did this.  
\item ~[Note: these are broad-level changes; specific responses to each 
reviewer comment are given below.]
\end{enumerate}

The point-by-point responses are as follows.


\subsection*{To the Peer Reviewer}

\begin{comment}
	This is where you insert the reviewer's first major comment. Copy their 
	concern verbatim here. It will be indented and appear in italics.
\end{comment}

This is where you respond to the reviewer's first major comment.

\begin{comment}
	This is where you insert the reviewer's second major comment, again  
	taken verbatim from the reviewer report.  
\end{comment}

This is where you respond to the reviewer's second major comment. Continue in 
this fashion until you have addressed \textit{all} of the reviewer's concerns,
both major and minor.

When you submit the final paper, you will need to include the sections 
currently commented out below for the grader and instructor responses to 
your first draft.
